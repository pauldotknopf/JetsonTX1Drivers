By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div><div id="wwpID0E0BV0HA" class="Body_Text">This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</div><div id="wwpID0E0AV0HA" class="Body_Text">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</div><div id="wwpID0E06U0HA" class="Body_Text">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div><div id="wwpID0E05U0HA" class="Body_Text">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.</div><div id="wwpID0E04U0HA" class="Body_Text">Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div><div id="wwpID0E03U0HA" class="Body_Text">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.</div><div id="wwpID0E02U0HA" class="Body_Text">When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</div><div id="wwpID0E01U0HA" class="Body_Text">We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.</div><div id="wwpID0E0ZU0HA" class="Body_Text">For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div><div id="wwpID0E0YU0HA" class="Body_Text">In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</div><div id="wwpID0E0XU0HA" class="Body_Text">Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.</div><div id="wwpID0E0WU0HA" class="Body_Text">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</div><div id="wwpID0E0VU0HA" class="Heading_3">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div><div id="wwpID0E0UU0HA" class="Body_Text" style="text-align: center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div><div id="wwpID0E0TU0HA" class="Body_Text">0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".</div><div id="wwpID0E0SU0HA" class="Body_Text">A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div><div id="wwpID0E0RU0HA" class="Body_Text"> The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)</div><div id="wwpID0E0QU0HA" class="Body_Text">"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.</div><div id="wwpID0E0PU0HA" class="Body_Text">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.</div><div id="wwpID0E0OU0HA" class="Body_Text">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</div><div id="wwpID0E0NU0HA" class="Body_Text">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div><div id="wwpID0E0MU0HA" class="Body_Text">2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div><div id="wwpID0E0LU0HA" class="List_Continue"> a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div><div id="wwpID0E0KU0HA" class="List_Continue">b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div><div id="wwpID0E0JU0HA" class="List_Continue"> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div><div id="wwpID0E0IU0HA" class="List_Continue">d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.</div><div id="wwpID0E0HU0HA" class="List_Continue">(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)</div><div id="wwpID0E0GU0HA" class="List_Continue">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div><div id="wwpID0E0FU0HA" class="List_Continue">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.</div><div id="wwpID0E0EU0HA" class="List_Continue">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</div><div id="wwpID0E0DU0HA" class="Body_Text">3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.</div><div id="wwpID0E0CU0HA" class="Body_Text"> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div><div id="wwpID0E0BU0HA" class="Body_Text">This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.</div><div id="wwpID0E0AU0HA" class="Body_Text"> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.</div><div id="wwpID0E06T0HA" class="Body_Text">If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div><div id="wwpID0E05T0HA" class="Body_Text">5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. </div><div id="wwpID0E04T0HA" class="Body_Text">However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div><div id="wwpID0E03T0HA" class="Body_Text">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div><div id="wwpID0E02T0HA" class="Body_Text">When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div><div id="wwpID0E01T0HA" class="Body_Text">If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div><div id="wwpID0E0ZT0HA" class="Body_Text">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div><div id="wwpID0E0YT0HA" class="Body_Text">6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:</div><div id="wwpID0E0XT0HA" class="List_Continue"> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)</div><div id="wwpID0E0WT0HA" class="List_Continue">b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div><div id="wwpID0E0VT0HA" class="List_Continue">c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.</div><div id="wwpID0E0UT0HA" class="List_Continue">d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.</div><div id="wwpID0E0TT0HA" class="List_Continue"> e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div><div id="wwpID0E0ST0HA" class="Body_Text">For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</div><div id="wwpID0E0RT0HA" class="Body_Text">It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.</div><div id="wwpID0E0QT0HA" class="Body_Text">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div><div id="wwpID0E0PT0HA" class="List_Continue"> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</div><div id="wwpID0E0OT0HA" class="List_Continue">b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div><div id="wwpID0E0NT0HA" class="Body_Text">8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div><div id="wwpID0E0MT0HA" class="Body_Text">9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.</div><div id="wwpID0E0LT0HA" class="Body_Text">10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div><div id="wwpID0E0KT0HA" class="Body_Text">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</div><div id="wwpID0E0JT0HA" class="Body_Text">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div><div id="wwpID0E0IT0HA" class="Body_Text">12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div><div id="wwpID0E0HT0HA" class="Body_Text">13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</div><div id="wwpID0E0GT0HA" class="Body_Text">14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div><div id="wwpID0E0FT0HA" class="Body_Text">			    NO WARRANTY</div><div id="wwpID0E0ET0HA" class="Body_Text">15.

You can apply it to your programs, too.</div><div id="wwpID0E0CS0HA" class="Body_Text">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div><div id="wwpID0E0BS0HA" class="Body_Text">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div><div id="wwpID0E0AS0HA" class="Body_Text">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.

We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.

Each licensee is addressed as "you".</div><div id="wwpID0E0ZR0HA" class="Body_Text">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program (independent of having been made by running the Program).

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</div><div id="wwpID0E0XR0HA" class="Body_Text">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div><div id="wwpID0E0WR0HA" class="Body_Text">2.

(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div><div id="wwpID0E0SR0HA" class="Body_Text">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div><div id="wwpID0E0RR0HA" class="Body_Text">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</div><div id="wwpID0E0QR0HA" class="Body_Text">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</div><div id="wwpID0E0PR0HA" class="Body_Text">3.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div><div id="wwpID0E0FR0HA" class="Body_Text">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div><div id="wwpID0E0ER0HA" class="Body_Text">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</div><div id="wwpID0E0DR0HA" class="Body_Text">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div><div id="wwpID0E0CR0HA" class="Body_Text">8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.

If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free software Foundation.

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing "real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images, very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment with various compression settings.</div><div id="wwpID0E03F0HA" class="Body_Text">This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.</div><div id="wwpID0E02F0HA" class="Body_Text">We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</div><div id="wwpID0E01F0HA" class="Body_Text">In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</div><div id="wwpID0E0ZF0HA" class="Body_Text">The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</div><div id="wwpID0E0YF0HA" class="Body_Text">We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.

Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.</div><div id="wwpID0E0CF0HA" class="Body_Text">The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".

This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here...</div><div id="wwpID0E0WE0HA" class="Body_Text">The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG in existence, and we highly recommend it.</div><div id="wwpID0E0VE0HA" class="Body_Text">The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead; it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.) In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212) 642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of 1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7% shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.</div><div id="wwpID0E0UE0HA" class="Body_Text">Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3, a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.

The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.</div><div id="wwpID0E0LE0HA" class="Heading_5">ARCHIVE LOCATIONS</div><div id="wwpID0E0KE0HA" class="Body_Text">=================</div><div id="wwpID0E0JE0HA" class="Body_Text">The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet address 192.48.96.9).

In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/. Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is; you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.</div><div id="wwpID0E06D0HA" class="Body_Text">A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford, is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use; it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG, which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)</div><div id="wwpID0E05D0HA" class="Heading_5">FILE FORMAT WARS</div><div id="wwpID0E04D0HA" class="Body_Text">================</div><div id="wwpID0E03D0HA" class="Body_Text">Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library. The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own, creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to exchange compressed files.)</div><div id="wwpID0E02D0HA" class="Body_Text">The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation. We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely supported, unfortunately.</div><div id="wwpID0E01D0HA" class="Body_Text">The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF. SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not. (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)</div><div id="wwpID0E0ZD0HA" class="Body_Text">Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist. We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't use a proprietary file format!</div><div id="wwpID0E0YD0HA" class="Body_Text">TO DO</div><div id="wwpID0E0XD0HA" class="Body_Text">=====</div><div id="wwpID0E0WD0HA" class="Body_Text">The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.
